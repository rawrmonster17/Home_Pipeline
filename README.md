# Home_Pipeline

Short project description here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This was tested with python 3.11 and venv.

### Installing

To install python3.11 and venv:
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv
Then you will need to create a virtual environment in the project directory:
cd Home_Pipeline
python3.11 -m venv ./
You will then enter into the virtual enviroment:
source ./bin/activate
Make the script executable:
chmod o+x src/main.py
execute the main script:
./src/main.py

## Running the tests

I do not have any testing yet as this repo is too new. I plan to add some tests in the future.

## Deployment

At this moment I have only tested on ubuntu 23.10 but I plan to do more testing later.
